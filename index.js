// javaScript Practice

// Variables

// declare using const

const a = 10; //const is a block const meaning constant value which cant be update
var b = 10; //var is used to store variable it is not consider good value because it cause issues
let c = 10; //let is a block level variable which can be update
// we can also declare a variable using just identifiers / name
